# Server-Client System for Object Detection and Data Exchange

## Overview

This project consists of a **server-client** system that facilitates object detection and data exchange between a client and a server. The **server** handles requests, generates data, and returns a response with image metadata, including translations and health status. The **client** uses this data, processes the image using a YOLO object detection model, and sends the results back to the server.
We created this system to simulate competetion in Teknofest's Ulaşımda Yapay Zeka Category.
